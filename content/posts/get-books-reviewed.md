# Get Books Reviewed: How the Platform Operates and How It Differs from Pubby

Get Books Reviewed is another platform designed to help authors increase the number of reviews on their Amazon books. At a glance it looks similar to other review-exchange communities, but its mechanics, incentives, and reviewer behavior patterns work differently.

This article explains the structure of Get Books Reviewed in clear detail — how reviews are earned, how requests are processed, what authors actually receive, and how the system differs from Pubby’s familiar “snaps-for-reviews” model.

---

# What Get Books Reviewed Is (and Is Not)

Get Books Reviewed positions itself as an **author-driven review community** where each member contributes reviews to earn the ability to request them.  
It is not a “pay-per-review” service and does not sell reviews directly. Instead, it uses a **closed internal credit economy** that regulates the entire flow of reviews.

The platform focuses exclusively on books, which makes the audience slightly more consistent and specialized than mixed-product review systems.

# The Core Mechanics of Get Books Reviewed

To understand how the system functions, let’s break down each stage from registration to receiving your first Amazon review.

## 1. Subscription-Based Access

Like most exchange communities, Get Books Reviewed is subscription-based.  
Authors pay a recurring monthly fee that grants access to:

- the reviewer pool
- the credit system
- the internal book library
- review tracking tools

Importantly:

> The subscription does **not** buy you reviews. It only gives you access to the system that *allows* you to earn and spend credits.

This structure is similar to Pubby, but the credit distribution and reviewer incentives differ significantly.

---

## 2. Credit System (But More Controlled Than Pubby)

Get Books Reviewed uses credits (the name varies depending on the plan), but the earning rules are stricter:

- You earn credits by completing reviews for other authors.
- The number of reviews you can take simultaneously is limited.
- Deadlines are typically shorter, especially for shorter books.
- Higher-quality reviews often earn bonus credits.
- Missed deadlines reduce your internal rating and future visibility.

This rating system is one of the biggest differences:  
**reviewers with poor performance are automatically shown fewer tasks**, meaning authors receive reviews from members who consistently complete assignments.

Pubby, in contrast, allows many low-effort reviewers to remain in the pool simply because the system is large.

---

## 3. Creating a Book Listing in the System

When you add your book, you provide:

- title and metadata
- book category
- description / hook
- estimated reading time
- access type (file upload or Amazon read)
- optional reader notes or content warnings

Compared to Pubby, Get Books Reviewed puts more emphasis on **matching books to appropriate readers**.  
The platform uses your category and metadata to determine who sees your book in the review queue.

This reduces mismatches such as:

- romance authors reviewing business books
- sci-fi authors reviewing memoirs
- nonfiction readers forced into poetry or fantasy

This gives the resulting reviews a more genre-appropriate tone.

---

## 4. How Reviewers Choose Books

The reviewer experience on Get Books Reviewed is more structured than on Pubby:

### Reviewers do NOT freely browse a giant library.
Instead, the platform **pushes books** to reviewers based on:

1. genre match
2. reviewer history and preferences
3. credit balance
4. past reading patterns
5. reliability score

This “smart assignment” system means:

- reviewers see fewer irrelevant books
- authors receive reviews from people more likely to enjoy the genre
- the general quality of the review tends to be higher
- the community has fewer abandoned or expired tasks

Pubby’s open library allows cherry-picking, which leads to large gaps between popular genres (thrillers, romance) and slow genres (business, poetry).  
Get Books Reviewed tries to balance this automatically.

---

## 5. Review Workflow

Once a reviewer accepts your book, the system works as follows:

1. Reviewer receives a reading deadline.
2. Reviewer reads through your uploaded file or Amazon version.
3. Reviewer writes a **full, neutral, honest** Amazon review.
4. Reviewer submits proof that the review is posted.
5. Get Books Reviewed verifies the review.
6. Credits are transferred to the reviewer.
7. You see the new review on your Amazon page and dashboard.

Verification usually happens through:

- automated scans
- manual checks for formatting or authenticity
- timestamp validation

This is slower than Pubby’s automated scans but reduces the number of fake submissions and abandoned tasks.

# Differences Between Get Books Reviewed and Pubby

This is the core section for authors trying to choose between the two.

## 1. **Review Quality Control**

**Pubby:**
- High speed, low depth.
- Reviewers skim to earn snaps fast.
- Many reviews feel formulaic or generic.

**Get Books Reviewed:**
- Slower but more deliberate.
- Genre matching improves authenticity.
- Reviewers who consistently deliver poor-quality work get fewer assignments.

**Result:**  
Reviews tend to sound more like genuine reader feedback, not like template text.

---

## 2. **Assignment Matching System**

**Pubby:** open browsing.  
Reviewers choose based on what earns snaps fastest.

**Get Books Reviewed:** guided assignment.  
The system distributes books based on genre, length, reviewer history, and interest.

**Result:** better alignment between book and reviewer.

---

## 3. **Reviewer Motivation and Penalties**

Get Books Reviewed includes:

- reviewer ratings
- late penalties
- cooldowns
- reduced visibility for unreliable users

Pubby does not penalize missed reviews severely, which leads to:

- abandoned assignments
- inconsistent follow-through
- waiting for reviews that never appear

**Result:** Get Books Reviewed produces more consistent delivery.

---

## 4. **Review Verification Process**

**Pubby:**  
Fast automatic scanning (sometimes over-sensitive, sometimes misses).

**Get Books Reviewed:**  
Combination of automated and manual review checks to confirm that:

- the review is actually posted
- the Amazon account is valid
- content is not plagiarized
- the review fits platform guidelines

This extra layer reduces:

- false completions
- scam reviewers
- duplicate text issues

---

## 5. **Flow and Timing**

**Pubby:**  
Fast but chaotic — you may receive 4 reviews in a week and then nothing for a month.

**Get Books Reviewed:**  
Slower but steadier — fewer spikes, more predictable pacing.

---

# Strengths of Get Books Reviewed

- More reliable reviewer base
- Higher chance of genre-accurate reviews
- Reduced volume of “generic filler” reviews
- Controlled workflow that lowers task drop-off
- Better alignment with Amazon’s expectations for genuine reader reviews
- Good dashboard clarity
- Less “gameable” system compared to Pubby

Authors using the platform often describe their reviews as:

- more thoughtful
- more specific
- more personalized
- less robotic

---

# Limitations to Keep in Mind

No review-exchange system is perfect. Get Books Reviewed still has constraints:

- Slower review flow compared to Pubby
- Requires continuous author participation
- Still an exchange model (not fully risk-free under Amazon policy)
- Limited appeal for niche genres with very small audiences
- Requires more reading effort from reviewers, so volume is lower

---

# When Get Books Reviewed Makes Sense

The platform works best if you want:

- deeper reviews
- genre-relevant reviewers
- predictable pacing
- fewer abandoned tasks
- a less chaotic alternative to Pubby

It is not ideal if you want:

- the fastest possible spikes
- extremely low effort participation
- large bursts of reviews in a few days

---

# Final Thoughts

Get Books Reviewed is essentially a **more structured, more curated, and more controlled version** of the classic review-exchange community.  
Its biggest strengths are reviewer consistency, genre matching, and review quality.

It demands more effort from participants and delivers reviews at a steadier pace, but the tradeoff is worthwhile for authors who care about:

- realism,
- authenticity,
- and genre-appropriate feedback.

In short:  
**Pubby is faster, Get Books Reviewed is cleaner and more reliable.**  
Which one is “better” depends on your goals, timeline, and expectations for review quality.
