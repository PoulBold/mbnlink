# Pubby Explained: How the Review-Exchange Platform Actually Works

Getting Amazon reviews has always been the biggest struggle for self-published authors. Pubby is one of the oldest and most well-known platforms built specifically to solve that problem.
But most authors only understand the surface: *you review books, other people review yours.*

In reality, the system is much more structured, and the way Pubby operates affects the quality, safety, and usefulness of the reviews you receive. This article breaks down the platform in a transparent, neutral, and practical way so authors can make informed decisions.

## What Pubby Really Is

Pubby is **not** a typical “review service” and **not** a platform that sells reviews. It is essentially a **review exchange marketplace**:

> You give reviews → you earn credits → you spend credits to receive reviews on your book.

The platform coordinates thousands of small transactions between authors.
You are not reviewing the same people who review you. Instead, Pubby uses a **round-robin economy** powered by an internal virtual currency to keep the cycle moving.

# The Core Mechanics of Pubby

Чтобы понять Pubby до конца, нужно разобрать, что происходит “под капотом”.

## 1. The Subscription Model

Pubby charges authors a recurring monthly fee.
This payment does **not** buy you reviews directly — it simply unlocks access to the community.

Inside the platform, every review you request is paid using **internal credits**, often called “snaps.”
The subscription only allows you to earn and spend these snaps.

So the money buys *participation*, not reviews.

---

## 2. Earning Snaps by Reviewing Other Authors

Snaps are the central currency.
To get reviews for your book, you must first **review other books** to earn snaps.

The platform sets rules that regulate this process:

- You cannot take many books at once — usually one “checked out” book at a time.
- You are given a specific **deadline** to complete the review.
- If the book is longer, Pubby gives you more time.
- Only after your Amazon review is submitted and verified do you receive snaps.

This creates a loop:

1. You pick a book.
2. You read it (often partially).
3. You publish a review on Amazon.
4. Pubby verifies it.
5. You get snaps.
6. You can now spend snaps to get reviews.

Because snaps take time to earn, authors are **forced** to contribute reviews in order to receive reviews.

---

## 3. Spending Snaps to Request Reviews on Your Book

Once you accumulate snaps, you can activate your book for reviews.
This means your book becomes **visible inside Pubby’s library**, where other users can pick it up.

You cannot select reviewers manually.
Instead, Pubby works like a queue:

- Your book enters the review pool.
- Reviewers browsing the library see it.
- Someone selects it if it matches their interest.
- They get a deadline to complete their review.
- You wait for Amazon to publish it.
- Pubby automatically detects the new review and marks the task as done.

If the reviewer never submits the review, the task eventually **expires**, snaps return to you, and the book becomes available for the next reviewer.

---

## 4. The Three Types of Reviews Supported

Pubby allows three access methods for reviewers:

### 1. **Reading the uploaded file**
The author uploads a PDF/EPUB.
The reviewer reads it directly without going to Amazon to purchase it.

### 2. **Reading via Kindle Unlimited**
The reviewer reads the book through KU, generating page reads.

### 3. **Purchasing the ebook**
This produces a **Verified Purchase** review.

However:

- Few reviewers choose purchase-based tasks.
- Higher snap-cost limits how often authors request this type.
- Many authors price their ebooks low to make these tasks more attractive.

All three types get posted through Amazon’s normal review system.

# The User Experience for Reviewers

Understanding the reviewer side is essential because it directly affects the quality of the reviews you receive.

Most reviewers try to:

- Complete books quickly
- Earn snaps efficiently
- Comply with deadlines

This often leads to:

- Surface-level reading
- Generic summaries
- Standardized review structure
- Overuse of phrases such as “well-written,” “engaging,” “informative”

This efficiency-driven behavior is not malicious — it is simply the result of Pubby’s incentives. Reviewers are motivated to **finish fast**, not to provide deep literary analysis.

# What Authors Actually Get from Pubby

## ▶️ Short-Term Benefits
**1. Fast initial reviews**
New authors often see several reviews appear within days.

**2. Predictable workflow**
You always know you will get a review once enough snaps are spent.

**3. A structured dashboard**
Pubby shows who picked your book, who submitted, and which reviews appeared on Amazon.

**4. Jumpstart for new books**
Books with zero reviews often struggle to get any visibility. Pubby can fix that quickly.

---

## ▶️ The Tradeoffs and Limitations

### 1. Review Quality Is Often Shallow
Because reviewers want to maximize snaps per hour, they may:

- skim instead of reading deeply
- rely heavily on the description
- produce very similar review formats
- avoid nuanced criticism

This leads to reviews that feel repetitive and generic.

### 2. Ethical and Policy Considerations
Although Pubby does not pay reviewers for positive ratings, Amazon’s guidelines discourage **organized review exchanges**, even indirect ones.

Pubby tries to avoid direct “you review me – I review you,” but the **economy is still reciprocal**, making the system sit in a **policy grey zone**.

### 3. Heavy Time Investment
You must constantly:

- pick up books
- read them
- write detailed reviews
- meet deadlines

Time spent reviewing is time you do **not** spend writing your next book or promoting your brand.

### 4. Reviewer–Audience Mismatch
Reviewers on Pubby are mostly:

- authors, not readers
- people reading outside their preferred genre
- motivated by snaps, not by organic interest

This can affect how authentic the feedback feels.

# How Pubby Fits Into a Modern Marketing Strategy

Pubby can be a **tactical tool**, but it should not be your primary long-term strategy for building reviews.

Think of it this way:

- It is good for **early traction**, not for **building a loyal audience**.
- It provides **volume**, not deep **reader engagement**.
- It produces **surface-level proof**, not **lasting fanbase trust**.

Best use-cases:

- New book launch (first 5–15 reviews)
- Testing whether your cover or blurb repels readers
- Rebuilding a dead listing with no recent reviews

Not ideal for:

- Establishing a brand
- Getting high-quality, story-rich reviews
- Long-term organic visibility

# Final Evaluation

Pubby is neither a scam nor a magic solution.
It is simply a **review-sharing ecosystem with an internal credit economy**, where every member contributes reviews in exchange for receiving reviews.

The platform works — but within clear limits.

**Pubby is good for:**

- Quick review generation
- Early social proof
- Authors who can invest time into reviewing others

**Pubby is not good for:**

- Deep, thoughtful reviews
- Genre-accurate feedback
- Long-term Amazon strategy
- Authors who want purely organic reviews from real fans

In the right hands, Pubby can be a short-term accelerator.
But for true growth, authors still need:

- an engaged audience
- strong content
- ethical review requests
- long-term fan relationships

Pubby can start the fire — but it won’t keep it burning.
